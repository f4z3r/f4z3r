### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am f4z3r, a software engineer who spends 99% of his time optimising his setup to make it work 1%
faster. I am passionate about cloud native software and infrastructure, security tooling, and
various programming languages.

I work on a variety of projects in various roles, such as:

- as a principal software architect at [ipt](https://ipt.ch/en/), working on various mandates.
- regularly contributing to open source, on projects such as
  [wasmCloud](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud),
  [HashiCorp Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault), the Kubernetes ecosystem, and various
  others.
- maintaining of the [`gruvbox-material.nvim`](https://github.com/f4z3r/gruvbox-material.nvim)
  NeoVim plugin.
- writing of a couple Lua tools and libraries such as [`sofa`](https://github.com/f4z3r/sofa),
  [`luatext`](https://github.com/f4z3r/luatext), [`luatables`](https://github.com/f4z3r/luatables),
  and [`luakube`](https://github.com/f4z3r/luakube).
- hacking away on my [NixOS setup](https://github.com/f4z3r/nix).
- preaching on split keyboards, NeoVim, and other pretty useless but incredibly fun things to anyone
  what wants to led me their ear.

I am okay at:
